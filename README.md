# C-assignment-2 - TRUTH & LIAR GAME
Purpose:This program reads and analyzes a grid of characters to determine if it                                                        conforms to specific patterns known as Line Solutions, Trivial solutions, and Irregular                                                 solutions. Each person must be able to say that they can see one liar adjacent to them for it to be considered a valid solution
